# Slawa Startup Guidelines

> There 10 types of people in the world - those who understand binary and those who don't.

## About

In this blog I will write down my ideas about making startups from the point of view of a software developer living in Germany. I have been working for 20+ years as a developer and worked on the side projects in parallel and trying to make a business out of them.

I have always hesitated expressing my thoughts. I suffered an Impostor Syndrome*. Recently I realized that I have gathered some knowledge that others don't have. Let me share that with you.

> Impostor Syndrome - a feeling that you and your opinion is unworthy and that others know better and who are you to teach anybody.

## Target audience

Every software product is designed for a specific target audience, broad or narrow. I think it's important to define the audience of this blog so that people who are not interested don't waste their time reading.

#### There are two types of people in the world - those who work for somebody and those who hire others.

Most people are working their 9 to 5 jobs. I appreciate what they do, their work is important. There are also those who organize, steer and manage the work of other people. We call them enterpreneurs.

I subdivide the enterpreneurs into two categories. Those who have the "real" skills and those who have the skill to talk. Both skills are equally important. It takes two to have a viable company. The company needs to produce the real product and provide value. And we need someone to talk others into buying this product. That's why most successful startups have two founders - techincal and business.

Look at the history - it has always been like this. There were [artisans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan) (craftsman, greek: [tékhnē](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/τέχνη), hence "technology") and merchants. Artisans create, merchants sell. One can no be sucessful without the other. Together they have much bigger success.

If you are a craftsman - you need to find a business partner. If you are a business person - you need to find a skillful CTO*.

> CTO - Chief Technology Officer - an typical abbreviation for a technical co-founder. There's also a CEO - Chief Executive Officer - business co-founder.

#### TL;DR; The target audience for this blog is the craftsman who had an idea for the business, but doesn't know where to start.

How do you find a co-founder? I am going to explain that in my next articles.
