I feel like I'm surrounded by perfectionists. I've been working on multiple projects with multiple people. 
When I think the prototype is 80% ready I want to show it to the world and get feedback. 
But not with my friends and partners. They meticulously find just one more issue, ask to add just one more feature 
or implement a beautifully convenient payment system even before we had a single person see the product.

Maybe the idea is wrong, maybe the features are missing, maybe the colors are off, maybe it's just stupid.
Hundreds of reasons why the project will fail and you can only find out if you let it go and have other people test it.

That's what this book is about - convincing people to release the prototype out to the world early. 
And continue improving it but not based on the assumptions of the two co-founders - on the real feedback of the real people.

#### TL;DR; Fail fast!
